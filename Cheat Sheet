2. Operators
2.1 Comparison Operators
Operator	Usage	Description
Equal ( == )	a == b	returns true if both a and b values are equal.
Not equal ( != )	a != b	returns true if both a and b values are not equal.
Strict equal ( === )	a === b	returns true if both a and b values are equal and of the same type.
Strict not equal ( !== )	a !== b	returns true if either a and b values are not equal or of the different type.
Greater than ( > )	a > b	returns true if a value is greater than b value.
Greater than or equal ( >= )	a >= b	returns true if a value is greater than or equal to b value.
Less than ( < )	a < b	returns true if a value is less than b value.
Less than or equal ( <= )	a <= b	returns true if a value is less than or equal to b value.
2.2 Logical Operators
Operator	Usage	Description
AND ( && )	a && b	returns true if both a and b values are true.
OR ( | | )	a | | b	returns true if either a or b value is true.
NOT ( ! )	!a	returns true if a value is not true.

3. More Events
Events are the actions by which the user or browser interact with HTML elements.

There are different types of events.

Keyboard Events
Mouse Events
Touch Events, and many more.
3.1 Keyboard Events
Keyboard Event is the user interaction with the keyboard.

The keyboard events are

keydown
keyup
3.1.1 Keydown event
The keydown event occurs when a key on the keyboard is pressed.

Syntax: element.addEventListener("keydown", function);

JAVASCRIPT
3.1.2 Keyup event
The keyup event occurs when a key on the keyboard is released.

Syntax: element.addEventListener("keyup", function);

3.2 Event Object
Whenever an event happens, the browser creates an event object.

It consists of information about the event that has happened.

It consists of many properties and methods.

type
target
key
timeStamp
stopPropagation, and many more.
3.2.1 Properties & Methods
For any event, event-specific properties and methods will be present.

For Example,

The keydown event has key property, whereas the onclick event doesn't have it.

event.type
The event.type property contains the type of event occurred like click, keydown, etc.

JAVASCRIPT
event.target
The event.target property contains the HTML element that triggered the event.

JAVASCRIPT
event.key
The event.key property contains the value of the key pressed by the user.

JAVASCRIPT
Keyboard key	event.key value
Enter	Enter
a	a
A	A
1	1
*	*
<	<
